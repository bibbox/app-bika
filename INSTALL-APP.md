## Bika LIMS Installation Instructions 

* Install the Bika LIMS application from the BIBBOX store and wait for the logs to stop moving.

* Open up the application by clicking the application tile header in the Applications menu, or the dashboard/logs view.

* If BIBBOX finished the installation of Bika LIMS in the system, you will see the first setup screen. Here, click on **Install a Bika distribution** and enter the default login credentials **admin** / **admin**.
